# Analysis and Prediction of Car Prices

This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of car prices between 2014 and 2015. The data consists of sales data, detailing the specifications and condition of the car, sale date and ,of course, the price. Extensive data engineering and analysis has been conducted on the raw data, the result of which was used to test a multitude of machine learning models, which were additionally optimized. A comprehensive evaluation of these models provides valuable insights into the key factors influencing car prices and shows the effectiveness of machine learning in accurately predicting car values, or any transactional data for that matter.
